The following seems to work for me to make an extremely simple portfolio website:
1. Using RStudio, create an R Markdown project (I recommend saving as index.Rmd)
2. [Learn how to use R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) (it's awesome)
3. To preview/publish, Shift+Command+k to 'Knit Document' (exports to HTML)
4. Push to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (free and also awesome)
